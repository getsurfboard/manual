### Before

Initially, I was a loyal user of [Shadowsocks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.shadowsocks), using it almost 24/7 to enjoy the freedom of an open internet without the constraints of a censored environment.

I eventually noticed that when Shadowsocks was active, all outgoing UDP packets were being dropped (an issue I believe has since been resolved). This meant I had to manually disable Shadowsocks every time I wanted to play a game and re-enable it afterward—a tedious and inconvenient process.

### First Version

This led me to wonder: why not build a VPN app tailored to my specific needs? That’s how the first iteration, "SS_NG" (short for Shadowsocks Next Generation), came to life. While its UI and features were rudimentary, it served its purpose perfectly: forwarding traffic via the Shadowsocks protocol without blocking UDP. It quickly became my primary, always-on VPN app.

### Inspiration

Later, after switching to a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, I discovered Surge. I was immediately impressed by its capabilities, particularly:

- Beautiful design
- Comprehensive feature set
- Stability and performance
- Granular configuration rules
- Multi-platform support

In my view, Surge remains the premier VPN application for the Apple ecosystem.

### Nowadays

When I eventually returned to Android, I realized there wasn't a VPN app compatible with Surge configurations. This prompted me to revive the SS_NG project, rebuilding it with Surge’s design philosophy in mind. The new application features:

- Compatibility with Surge configuration formats
- Detailed traffic analytics and logging
- Support for remote node, rule, and proxy group switching
- ...

I named the new app "Surfboard"—sharing its first three letters with Surge while evoking the idea of "surfing" the web. Today, Surfboard has evolved from a personal side project into a public tool for anyone seeking a free and open internet experience.
