This meant I had to manually disable Shadowsocks every time I wanted to play a game and re-enable it afterward\u2014a tedious and inconvenient process.\\n\\n### First Version\\n\\nThis led me to wonder: why not build a VPN app tailored to my specific needs? That\u2019s how the first iteration, \\"SS_NG\\" (short for Shadowsocks Next Generation), came to life. While its UI and features were rudimentary, it served its purpose perfectly: forwarding traffic via the Shadowsocks protocol without blocking UDP. It quickly became my primary, always-on VPN app.\\n\\n### Inspiration\\n\\nLater, after switching to a MacBook Pro and an iPhone, I discovered Surge. I was immediately impressed by its capabilities, particularly:\\n\\n- Beautiful design\\n- Comprehensive feature set\\n- Stability and performance\\n- Granular configuration rules\\n- Multi-platform support\\n\\nIn my view, Surge remains the premier VPN application for the Apple ecosystem.\\n\\n### Nowadays\\n\\nWhen I eventually returned to Android, I realized there wasn\'t a VPN app compatible with Surge configurations. This prompted me to revive the SS_NG project, rebuilding it with Surge\u2019s design philosophy in mind. The new application features:\\n\\n- Compatibility with Surge configuration formats\\n- Detailed traffic analytics and logging\\n- Support for remote node, rule, and proxy group switching\\n- ...\\n\\nI named the new app \\"Surfboard\\"\u2014sharing its first three letters with Surge while evoking the idea of \\"surfing\\" the web. Today, Surfboard has evolved from a personal side project into a public tool for anyone seeking a free and open internet experience."}]}}')}}]);
