# `[Host]`

The `[Host]` section is used to define static DNS mappings, allowing users to override default DNS resolution for specific domains or wildcard patterns.

This feature is particularly useful for local development, testing servers with custom domains, or forcing specific IP resolutions without modifying the system's global hosts file.
